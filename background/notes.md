# Study design

* 3 study groups
  * Control
  * MBSR in-person
  * MBSR video
* Subject recruitment and intervention occurs in waves; need to account for clustering by wave
  * 6 waves over the timetable
  * Subjects at each wave will be randomized to any of the 3 study groups; i.e., each cluster will have all study groups represented
* Assessments made at baseline, `t0`, and post-intervention, `t1`


# SA1

  * Primary outcome: PSS at `t1`
  * Secondary outcomes at `t1`
    * Salivary cortisol
    * PDQ-39
    * HamA&D
* Use values at `t0` to adjust
